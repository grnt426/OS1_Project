Description:	A Command Line Utility that can proceess input and run the 
				associated task in the foreground or background.  Keeps a list
				of the previously typed 20 commands and ensures the user does
				not provide empty or whitespace padded commands.
				
KNOWN BUGS:		
				Typing "history" and then immediately hitting ctrl-C causes
				the signal handler function to read an infinte number of
				SIGSEGV.  Reason is unknown.
				
				Running a process in the backgruond will work, but will always
				cause that command to run in the background regardless if the
				'&' is present or not.  It seems that strtok() is the culprit
				but not certain.
